Welcome to the repository for our journal article entitled "Widespread but Undetected: The Cryptic Invasion of Non-Native Cattail (<i>Typha</i>) in a Pacific Northwest Estuary", which was published in <i>Estuaries and Coasts</i> in 2023. 

You will find the following contents in this repository:

### [Publication Files](https://github.com/asarum-ecological/2023_UndetectedTypha/tree/main/Publication%20Files)
  - a .pdf of the accepted manuscript
  - a .pdf of the digital supplemental materials 

### [Spectral Analysis](https://github.com/asarum-ecological/2023_UndetectedTypha/tree/main/Spectral%20Analysis%20)
  - outputs of spectral analysis, visualised in a cattail density raster
  
### [Species Distribution Model](https://github.com/asarum-ecological/2023_UndetectedTypha/tree/main/Species%20Distribution%20Model)
  - channel proximity & elevation environmental rasters
  - suitability and susceptibility output rasters
  - .jpeg maps of key conservation areas of the estuary

Any additional data may be available upon request. Please note that all of the imagery datasets used in our spectral analysis were not publicly available and generously leant to us from the BC Government and Vancouver Fraser Port Authority. Similarly, the % sand layer from our SDM were not publicly available. 

The extent of non-native cattail in the estuary continues to be investigated. For an up to date map of field-verified cattail please visit this [link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Gxm6n921sl6ph-dF6LTEKDhTrqaUaCoK&ll=49.137229809022216%2C-123.15205739999999&z=11).
