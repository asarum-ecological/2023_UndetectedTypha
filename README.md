# Repository for Stewart, Hood and Martin (2023)

Welcome to the repository for our journal article entitled "Widespread but Undetected: The Cryptic Invasion of Non-Native Cattail in a Pacific Northwest Estuary", which was published in the journal Estuaries and Coasts in 2023. 

You will find the following contents in this repository:

## Publication Files
  - a .pdf of the published manuscript (this will appear 12 months after publication)
  - a .pdf of the digital supplemental materials 

## Spectral Analysis
  - outputs of spectral analysis at various resolutions for both imagery datasets
  - Polygon shapefile of our training datasets
  
## Species Distribution Model
  - channel proximity environmental layer (for suitability model)
  - proximity to nearest patch and cattail density layers (for susceptibility model)
  
Any additional data may be available upon request. Please note that all of the imagery datasets used in our spectral analysis were not publicly available and generously leant to us from the BC Government and Vancouver Fraser Port Authority. Similarly, the DEM and % sand layers from our SDM were not publicly available. 

Should you have any inquiries, please feel free to reach out me.
